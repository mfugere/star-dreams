star-dreams
===========

Every night, Evan would lay in her bed and look up at the stars, dreaming about what it would be like to fly up through the trees and birds and clouds.  She wanted to swim amongst the stars.

However, the stars would slowly disappear.  Night after night sheâ€™d see fewer and fewer stars.  By autumn, there were none left.  It was very dark and lonely.

Evan felt her dreams shattering.  She could not stand for this.  She had to find out why the stars were no longer shining.  The next day, she ran off to find the highest hill she could.  This would be where her journey up would begin.

It was time to make her dreams a reality.

**Star Dreams** is a vertical platformer in which you control Evan, who must find out why the stars have disappeared, and bring them back. It is based in HTML5/JavaScript, and uses the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game library.
